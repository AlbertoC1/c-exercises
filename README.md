# C Practice #3

These files are short C exercises that you need to complete. Each file has comments that
explain the goal, expected output, and TODOs to finish.

- 01-03: if/else with simple input/output
- 04-05: while loops for input validation
- 06-08: writing and calling functions
- 09-11: working with arrays (no pointers needed)

To try one exercise:
1) Open the matching `.c` file and complete the TODOs.
2) Compile with gcc, for example:
   `gcc 01-if-else-temperature.c -o temp`
   Then, you can run it:
   `./temp`
3) Rerun after changes until your output matches the examples in the comments.
